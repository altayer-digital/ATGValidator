/**
 Base protocol to be conformed while creating a new validation rule.

 - note:
 There are 2 requirements in this protocol
 - error: This is the error, which will be returned if the rule is failed on the input.
 - validate(value:): This method should do the actual validation and return a result with status
 as either success or failure. In case of failure, the result's errors property needs to be filled
 with the corresponding error object.

     Validation implementation method.
     - parameter value: The value to be passed in for validation.
     - returns: A result object with success or failure with errors.
